# python-refresher
(9/13): 
Completed get_columns function to return specified values that correspond to queried column and value.
Updated print_fires.py to use get_column correctly from my_utils.
Ensured my_utils.py only runs if main and that all python code satisfies pycodestyle. 
Changed results_column param in get_column to be a named parameter that defaults to 1. 
Created run.sh to execute print_fires.py.
-----------------
HW3:
Added try except blocks to get_columns function to handle file and type casting errors
print_fires now takes named command line arguments using argparse.
Test cases were added to run.sh.
